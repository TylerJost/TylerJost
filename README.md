# Hi I'm Tyler
I'm a 5th year graduate student in the [Brock Lab](https://www.brocklab.com/) at UT Austin. I combine single-cell transcriptomics, imaging, and deep learning to better understand phenotype composition, stability, and change in *in-vitro* cancer cell lines.

# Project Overview

## Deep Learning for Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is an imaging modality that already has multiple industrial uses for identification of chemicals. It has also been shown as a tool for label-free identification of biological matter such as pathogenic bacteria. We questioned whether it would be useful for identifying cells with minimal RNA expression differences that would normally be identifiable only through sequencing methods. While this project never reached publication status, it was an interesting venture into 3D convolutional neural networks. Previous work only used the maximum intensity image, however we hypothesized that using all of the spectra within a cell could provide a better input for a deep neural network.
